# Intro to Climbing: A Beginner's Guide

Are you interested in trying climbing, but not sure where to start? This beginner's guide is here to help!

## Choosing a Type of Climbing
There are several different types of climbing to choose from, each with its own set of challenges and equipment requirements.

- Gym climbing: This type of climbing takes place in an indoor climbing gym and is a great option for beginners. Gym climbing allows you to learn the basics of climbing and get comfortable with the equipment in a controlled environment.
- Sport climbing: This type of climbing involves climbing routes that have bolts placed in the rock for protection. Sport climbing is typically done outdoors and requires a higher level of skill and experience than gym climbing.
- Traditional climbing: Also known as trad climbing, this type of climbing involves placing your own protection as you climb. Trad climbing requires a higher level of skill and experience than sport climbing, as well as a larger rack of equipment.

## Getting Started
Once you've decided on the type of climbing you want to try, it's time to get started! Here are a few things you'll need to get started with gym climbing:

- Climbing shoes: These specialized shoes are designed to give you the grip and precision you need to climb successfully.
- Harness: A climbing harness is worn around the waist and legs and is used to attach you to the climbing rope.
- Belay device: A belay device is used to control the rope and keep the climber safe.

## Safety First
Climbing can be a physically challenging and rewarding activity, but it's important to prioritize safety at all times. Make sure to follow proper techniques and use the appropriate equipment, and never climb beyond your abilities.

## Have Fun!
Above all, the most important thing is to have fun! Climbing is a great way to challenge yourself physically and mentally, and with a little practice and patience, you'll be on your way to reaching new heights.
