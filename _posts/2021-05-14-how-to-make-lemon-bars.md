# How to Make Lemon Bars

Lemon bars are a refreshing and tangy dessert that are perfect for spring and summer. Here's a simple recipe for making them at home:

## Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup powdered sugar
- 1 cup butter, melted
- 4 eggs
- 1 1/2 cups white sugar
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup lemon juice

## Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C).
2. In a medium mixing bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups flour and powdered sugar. Add melted butter and mix until well combined. Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.
3. In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, white sugar, 1/4 cup flour, and lemon juice. Pour the mixture over the crust in the baking dish.
4. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden and the filling is set.
5. Let the lemon bars cool in the pan before cutting into squares and dusting with powdered sugar.

Enjoy your freshly baked lemon bars! They can be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to a week.
