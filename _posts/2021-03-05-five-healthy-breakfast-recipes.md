# 5 Healthy Breakfast Recipes

Starting your day with a healthy breakfast can set the tone for the rest of your day. Here are a few easy and delicious recipes to try:

## Overnight oats

Overnight oats are a convenient and tasty way to enjoy a healthy breakfast on the go. Simply mix together rolled oats, milk (dairy or non-dairy), a spoonful of your favorite nut butter, and any additional toppings or flavorings you like (such as fruit, nuts, or honey). Cover the mixture and refrigerate overnight, and the oats will soften and absorb the liquid. In the morning, grab your jar of oats and go!

## Avocado toast

Avocado toast is a simple yet satisfying breakfast option. Toast a slice of whole grain bread, mash half an avocado on top, and season with salt and pepper. You can also add a sprinkle of red pepper flakes or a squeeze of lemon juice for extra flavor.

## Scrambled eggs with vegetables

Scrambled eggs are a protein-packed breakfast option, and adding vegetables to the mix increases their nutrient content. Try saut√©ing some diced bell peppers, onions, and spinach in a pan, and then adding in a couple of beaten eggs. Scramble everything together until the eggs are cooked to your liking.

## Greek yogurt parfait

Greek yogurt is a great source of protein, and it's delicious when layered with fruit and granola. Simply layer yogurt, your choice of sliced fruit (such as berries or bananas), and a handful of granola in a jar or glass. Repeat the layers until you reach the top of the container.

## Smoothie bowl

Smoothie bowls are a quick and easy way to get your fruit fix in the morning. Blend together a banana, a handful of your favorite frozen fruit, a spoonful of nut butter, and a splash of milk (dairy or non-dairy).
