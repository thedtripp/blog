# Hiking Essentials for Beginners

Are you new to hiking and not sure what to bring on your next outdoor adventure? Here are a few essential items to include in your hiking pack:

## Water

It's important to stay hydrated while hiking, especially on longer or more strenuous trails. Make sure to bring enough water for your hike, or a water filter or purification tablets if you'll be near a water source.

## Snacks

Bringing along some snacks can help keep your energy levels up and sustain you on the trail. Choose energy-rich, non-perishable options like nuts, granola bars, or dried fruit.

## First-aid kit

Accidents can happen, even on a short hike. A small first-aid kit can be a lifesaver in case of minor injuries or emergencies. Make sure to include items like band-aids, gauze, and pain medication.

## Map and compass

If you're hiking in an unfamiliar area, it's a good idea to bring a map and compass to help you navigate. A GPS device can be useful as well, but be sure to bring backup navigation tools in case your device fails or runs out of battery.

## Sun protection

Don't forget to protect yourself from the sun's rays, especially at high altitudes. Pack sunscreen, a hat, and sunglasses to help prevent sunburn and eye damage.

## Clothing

Dress in layers to prepare for changes in weather. Make sure to bring a rain jacket or poncho in case of rain, and bring a warm layer for cooler temperatures. Wearing sturdy, comfortable shoes is also important for a safe and enjoyable hike.
