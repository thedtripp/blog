# Easy Homemade Pizza Recipe

Who doesn't love a delicious, homemade pizza? Here's an easy recipe for making your own pizza at home:

## Ingredients

- 1 cup of warm water
- 1 packet of active dry yeast
- 2 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp of salt
- 2 tbsp of olive oil
- 1 cup of tomato sauce
- 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese
- Your choice of toppings (such as vegetables, meat, or additional cheese)

## Method

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm water and yeast. Let the mixture sit for about 5 minutes, until the yeast has dissolved.

2. Add the flour, salt, and olive oil to the mixing bowl. Mix the ingredients together until a dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, you can add a little bit more flour.

3. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic.

4. Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover with a towel. Let the dough rise for about an hour, until it has doubled in size.

5. Preheat your oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.

6. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to your desired shape and thickness. Transfer the dough to a greased pizza pan or baking sheet.

7. Spread the tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese over the sauce.

8. Add your choice of toppings to the pizza.

9. Bake the pizza for about 15-20 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.

10. Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!
