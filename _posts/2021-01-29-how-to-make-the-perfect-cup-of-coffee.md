# How to Make the Perfect Cup of Coffee

There's nothing quite like a perfect cup of coffee to start your day off right. Here's a simple guide to brewing the perfect cup at home:

## Ingredients

- 1-2 tablespoons of ground coffee (depending on how strong you like your coffee)
- 6 ounces of water (for a single serving)
- Milk and sugar (optional)

## Equipment

- A coffee mug
- A coffee filter
- A coffee maker (such as a drip coffee maker or a French press)
- A kettle or pot for boiling water

## Method

1. Start by heating up your water. The ideal brewing temperature for coffee is between 190 and 205 degrees Fahrenheit, so bring your water to a boil and then let it cool for a minute before proceeding.

2. Place a coffee filter in your coffee maker or French press. If using a drip coffee maker, add the ground coffee to the filter. If using a French press, add the ground coffee to the bottom of the press.

3. Pour the hot water over the ground coffee. For a drip coffee maker, the water should pass through the coffee and into the mug or carafe below. For a French press, the water and coffee will mix together in the press.

4. If using a French press, let the coffee steep for about four minutes and then press down on the plunger to separate the coffee from the grounds.

5. Add milk and sugar to taste, if desired.

And that's it! With a little bit of practice, you'll be brewing the perfect cup of coffee in no time.
