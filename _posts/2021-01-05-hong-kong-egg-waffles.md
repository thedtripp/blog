# A Guide to Hong Kong Egg Waffles

## Introduction

If you've ever visited Hong Kong, chances are you've come across the iconic street food known as egg waffles (also called "egg puffs" or "gai daan jai"). These small, round waffles have a crispy, bubbly exterior and a soft, fluffy interior, and are often served as a sweet treat.

## History

Egg waffles have a long history in Hong Kong, dating back to the 1950s. They were originally created as a way to use up leftover cake batter and eggs, and were sold as a cheap snack on the streets. Today, egg waffles are a beloved part of Hong Kong's food culture, and can be found at street stalls and markets throughout the city.

## Flavors and Serving

Egg waffles are usually served in a cone or bag, and can be topped with a variety of sweet or savory ingredients. Traditional flavors include plain, chocolate, and green tea, but you can also find more creative flavors such as matcha, cheese, and even taro. They are meant to be eaten on the go and are typically served hot and fresh off the griddle. Some people even like to fill them with savory fillings like eggs, bacon, and cheese for a breakfast sandwich-like treat.
