# Dessert Review: Chocolate Chip Cookies

There's nothing quite like a warm, gooey chocolate chip cookie straight out of the oven. In this post, we'll be reviewing a classic chocolate chip cookie recipe to see how it stacks up.

## Recipe

For this review, we used the following recipe:

- 1 cup butter, softened
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- 2 eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 2 teaspoons hot water
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
2. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Dissolve baking soda in hot water. Add to batter along with salt. Stir in flour, chocolate chips, and nuts. Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets.
3. Bake for 8-10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Review

Overall, we were quite pleased with this chocolate chip cookie recipe. The cookies turned out perfectly soft and chewy, with a delicious balance of sweet and salty. The chocolate chips were gooey and melty, and the nuts added a nice crunch.

The only downside was that the recipe made a lot of dough â€“ enough for about 5 dozen cookies. If you're not planning on sharing (or have a lot of hungry friends), you may want to halve the recipe.

Overall, we'd definitely recommend giving this chocolate chip cookie recipe a try. It's a classic for a reason!
